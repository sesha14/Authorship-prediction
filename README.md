# Authorship-prediction
Authorship attribution means given a set of documents from a set of authors, create a system which, given a new unseen document can tell the original author of that document.
These systems have become extremely popular now-a-days. The primary task at hand is to define an appropriate characterization of the text files so that it captures the writing styles of the authors efficiently.
This is a problem that can readily be framed as a text classification task, “where author represents a class (label) of a given text [7],” One important scenario where such systems are being used is the identification of disputed documents. 
The problem arises when 2 or more people claim the authorship for a document. 
Another scenario could be to attribute the old historical pieces of writings to different eras, or perhaps the original author as well. 
Hence there is a need to have strong authorship attribution systems.
